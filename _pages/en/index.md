    <h1>The Price of Uncertainty</h1>
    <p>In critical decision-making, evidence is the only safe path. But what happens if that evidence is not solid?</p>
    <p>Flawed data analysis can lead to incorrect interpretations, the loss of valuable perspectives, and, most worryingly, ill-informed decisions that directly affect patients and your organization's growth.</p>
    <p>Hard work without rigorous analysis may not be enough. Uncertainty is not just a nuisance, it is a risk.</p>

    <h1>Success: When evidence guides you</h1>
    <p>Imagine a scenario where your data gives you the answers you need, when you need them.</p>
    <p>Success is having a clear understanding of the information you already have, discovering perspectives you didn't even know existed. It's moving from uncertainty to certainty.</p>
    <p>This translates into smart strategic decisions that drive efficiency, optimize growth and, most importantly, improve patient outcomes.</p>
    <p>With a solid foundation of evidence, your decisions will not only be correct, but will also inspire confidence and leadership.</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>“The physician who only knows medicine, knows not even medicine” — José de Letamendi</h2>
    <p>To me, being a doctor goes beyond clinical practice; every experience has been an opportunity to learn valuable lessons about the complexity of the world around us and how we can integrate that knowledge into healthcare.</p>
    <h2>Translating Knowledge into Action</h2>
    <p>My career path is proof that statistical rigor and clinical intuition are not opposites, but the way forward in modern evidence-based medicine.</p>

    <h3>Let's transform your ideas into actions</h3>
    <p>
      I firmly believe that <strong>great discoveries are born from collaboration and shared vision</strong>. 
      Due to my commitment to technical precision, I accept a limited number of challenges in parallel, 
      ensuring that each project receives the rigor and depth it deserves.
