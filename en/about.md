    title: "The Art of Persuading with Evidence"
    excerpt: "This award for **First Place in the XV SILAIS Granada Scientific Conference** is much more than a simple prize for my research. I consider it a tangible validation of **my ability to transform complex data into compelling narratives** that resonate with people.<br><br>This recognition proves that the real impact of science lies not only in its rigor but in the power to communicate it persuasively to inspire safer, evidence-based clinical decisions."

    excerpt: 'My experience with the **"Project Health for Leon"** cardiology brigade was not just a medical mission; it was a life lesson I will always treasure. It showed me that uniting talents is the way to humanize healthcare, achieving a profound impact on the lives of patients and their families.<br><br>It was precisely in this high-pressure environment where, after an initial database exploration, a question arose: Is there an index or indicator that allows us to perform timely triage in resource-limited settings? From that need to turn uncertainty into precision, the **Medication Burden Index** was born.'

    excerpt: 'At the **First Western Congress "Strengthening Maternal and Neonatal Health in the West,"** the value of science did not stay in reports; it was found in its ability to be discussed. This experience gave me the opportunity to translate **complex information into a practical and purposeful conversation**, something I consider fundamental to the success of any health initiative.<br><br>It showed me that scientific knowledge is most valuable when it becomes a story that has the power to resonate with people and influence decision-making.'

    <h1>Behind the Stethoscope: <br> Constant learning and <br> impactful persuasion in action</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>For me, personal development is a journey of continuous learning, where integrating diverse skills and experiences allows me to approach challenges from multiple perspectives. This approach broadens my understanding of the world and facilitates the generation of innovative and effective solutions for complex problems.</p>
    <p>Persuading and convincing are essential skills in my arsenal. I understand that persuasion is not just about presenting arguments, but about connecting emotionally with people and communicating the importance of an idea in a clear and compelling way.</p>

    <h1>Values that reflect my personal and professional approach</h1>
    <h2>Strength in Unity: Multiplying achievements through teamwork</h2>
    <p>The potential for synergy generated by joining efforts is invaluable. I believe in the diversity of opinions and skills, and I know that by collaborating with others, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve exceptional results.</p>

My commitment to rigorous analysis of available evidence fosters a mindset of critical thinking and objectivity, essential for discerning truth in a world full of diverging opinions.</p>

        <p>This book has taught me that human psychology—both the physician's and the patient's—plays a critical role in clinical outcomes. Through its pages, I understood how heuristics can save lives or lead to error, underlining the importance of systems that support human judgment.</p>
