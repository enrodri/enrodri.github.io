    What is Data Science, and how can it help my organization?
  </h3>
  <div class="toggle-content">
    <p>Data Science is a discipline that combines technology and mathematics to analyze large amounts of information and uncover patterns that are invisible to the naked eye.</p>
    <p>Think of it as a high-powered magnifying glass for your organization's data: It helps you predict disease outbreaks or identify patients at higher risk for certain conditions, enabling proactive care and, most importantly, clinical decision-making with a greater impact on patient outcomes.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggle-heading">
    What software and tools do you use?
  </h3>
  <div class="toggle-content">
    <p>My work is built on open-source tools, which are globally accessible and community-driven. My primary stack includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python:</strong> A versatile programming language I use to manage and analyze large-scale datasets.</li>
      <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> An interactive environment that allows me to present data analysis clearly, combining text, visualizations, and code in a single document.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> A platform I use for secure version control and code sharing, ensuring project transparency and reproducibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggle-heading">
    How do you guarantee the privacy and security of medical data?
  </h3>
  <div class="toggle-content">
    <p>Confidentiality is the cornerstone of my practice. I operate under strict <strong>data anonymization</strong> protocols, ensuring that no sensitive information can be traced back to an individual patient.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I utilize secure development environments and follow cybersecurity best practices for database management, aligning with the ethical principles of modern medical research.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggle-heading">
    What if my data is incomplete or "messy"?
  </h3>
  <div class="toggle-content">
    <p>This is one of the most common scenarios in real-world clinical settings. My expertise lies precisely in managing <strong>missing data and selection biases</strong>.</p>
    <p>I employ advanced techniques such as <strong>multiple imputation</strong> and probabilistic models to rescue valuable insights where others might only see noise, allowing for robust conclusions even in resource-limited environments.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggle-heading">
    What does the collaboration process look like?
  </h3>
  <div class="toggle-content">
    <p>My approach is cyclical and transparent:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Clinical Understanding:</strong> We define the medical question we want to answer.</li>
      <li><strong>Exploration and Diagnosis:</strong> I assess the quality and structure of the available data.</li>
      <li><strong>Model Development:</strong> I apply statistics and code to find the solution.</li>
      <li><strong>Translation:</strong> I deliver results into actionable insights for immediate decision-making.</li>

    <h3>Let's Transform Your Ideas into Action</h3>
    <p>
      I firmly believe that <strong>great discoveries are born from collaboration and shared vision</strong>. 
      Due to my commitment to technical precision, I accept a limited number of challenges concurrently, 
      ensuring that each project receives the rigor and depth it deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you are ready to turn data into action, I would love to hear your proposal.</strong>
