  - title: "Methodology: From Data to Decision"
  - excerpt: "My methodology transformed dry pharmacovigilance data into a clinical roadmap. The challenge wasn't just presenting the WHO Algorithm, but making the audience 'see' the 50% treatment dropout risk through a <strong>strategic visual hierarchy</strong>."
victory:
  - title: "The Victory Factor: Evidence in Action"
  - excerpt: "The success of this presentation lay in transforming complex pharmacoepidemiological findings into clinical decision triggers. This strategy allowed scientific evidence to shift from a static report to an impactful narrative that justified the need for active pharmacovigilance protocols."

  <h2>The Challenge: How to Make Data Matter?</h2>
  <p>At the XV Scientific Conference, my research revealed a critical point: <strong>50% of patients abandon their antihypertensive treatment due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs)</strong>. The challenge wasn't the data itself, but breaking through academic saturation to generate a real alert for decision-makers.</p>
