    <h1>Sepsis: Translating Clinical Trial Rigor to the Bedside</h1>
    <p>A case study on how data analysis and clinical evidence synthesis unified criteria in a high-pressure medical service.</p>

<h2>The Challenge: Unifying Criteria Amidst Uncertainty</h2>
<p>In sepsis management, information overload and high-profile clinical trial results often spark debate on the best course of action. My challenge was to act as a <strong>technical evaluator</strong>, analyzing evidence details to facilitate the medical team’s adoption of standardized practices.</p>
